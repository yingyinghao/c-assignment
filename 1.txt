1.What type would you choose for the following "numbers"?

A person's telephone number: string
A person's height: float - double
A person's age: Int
A person's gender(Male, Female, Prefer not to answer):enum
A person's salary:decimal
A book's ISBN:string

A book's shipping weight: float -double

The number of stars in the universe:ulong
The number of employees in each of the small or medium business in the United Kingdom(up to 
50,000 employees per business): ushort


2.What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?


3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET?


What's the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?



Controlling Flow and Converting Types
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
System.DivideByZeroException

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
positive double / 0 -> Infinity
negative double / 0 -> -Infinity
0.0 /0.0 ->Nan(not a number)

3.What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?


4.What is the difference between x=y++, and x=++y?
x=y++: assigns the value of y to x first, then increments y.
x=++y: increments y first, then assigns the new value to x.

5.What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop stament?
break: Exits the loop entirely
continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
return: Exits the loop and the entire method.

6.What are the three parts of a for statment and whch of them are required?
three parts: Initialization, Condition, Iteration
none are strictly required, but at least the condition must evaluate to true for the loop to execute.

7.What is the difference between the = and == operators?
=: Assignmen operator; assigns a value to a variable.
==: Equality operator; check if two values are equal.

8.Does the folowing statment compile? for(;true;);
Yes, it compiles. The condition(true) is valid, creating a infinite loop.

9.What does the underscore_ represent in a switch expression?
It represents the default case( a wildcard match)


10.What interface must an object implement be enumerated over by using the foreach statment?
The object must implement the IEnumerable interface(or IEnumerable<T>  for generics).


02 Arrays and Strings

1.When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
String: use when the string content is not expected to change frequently, string in C# are immutable, every modification creates a new string,
resulting in more memory and processing overhead.
StringBuilder:
Use when you expect to perform multiple string maipulations, more efficient for frequent modifications because it operates on a mutable buffer.
 
2.What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
System.Array
All arrays in C# derive from the System.Array class, which 


3.How do you sort an array in C#?
Array.Sort()

4.What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
int [] = numbers = {1,2,3,4}
int TotalElement = numbers.Length;

5.Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
Yes, but only if you define the array as an array of object.


6.What's the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?

Array.CopyTo(): Copies the elements of the array into an existing array starting at a specified index.

Array.Clone(): Creates a shallow copy of the array, returning a new array of the same type and size with the same elements.
